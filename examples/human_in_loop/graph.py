"""
Human-in-the-loop pattern: agent pauses for human approval before critical actions.

When to use: agents that write to databases, send emails, deploy infrastructure,
or take any irreversible action. The ``interrupt()`` call suspends execution and
returns control to the caller; a ``Command(resume=...)`` resumes it.

Architecture::

    START
      |
    plan_node       (LLM proposes an action)
      |
    approval_node   (interrupt() — pauses here, waits for human input)
      |
    route_approval  (conditional: approved? -> execute, rejected -> END)
      |          \\
    execute_node   END
      |
     END
